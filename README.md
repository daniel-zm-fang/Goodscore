# [Goodscore](https://goodscore-dev.web.app/)

Goodscore is a website that helps piano players keep track of their practice log, explore other sheet music, and share their journey with other piano players.
To get started, simply make an account. Then go to the dashboard, click the "plus" icon to add sheet music to your collection!
You can either add custom sheet music or use the search bar to find songs by composer of your choice.

Coming soon: add friends to see what sheet music they are learning.

Keep on practicing :)
